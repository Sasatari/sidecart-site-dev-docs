# Compatibility Issues

## Warning to all users
SidecarT has undergone extensive testing on various Atari ST, STE, MegaST, and MegaSTE computers featuring diverse TOS versions. However, it's important to note that this version does not support Atari TT, Falcon computers, and their clones. While heavily modified and customized computers are likely compatible, it’s up to you to decide to use the SidecarT.

No Atari ST computers were harmed during the development of SidecarT. It’s a homebrew product designed for hobbyists with a keen interest in experimenting with their computers. If you seek a seamless, Apple-like experience, SidecarT may not meet your expectations.

I am more than willing to issue refunds to users who encounter compatibility issues, but I am also open to collaborating with them to resolve any problems and understand the underlying causes.

## Incompatibility issues and severity

| Severity | Device Name | Computer Tested | Issue | Description | Fix |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-------|-------------|-----|
| CRITICAL | CosmoseX | MegaSTE | Corrupt storage in CosmoseX | Combining SidecarT with CosmoseX corrupts the content of the storage devices connected. | Not yet |
| LOW | Very low quality microSD cards | All | microSD cards not detected | Some very low cost Aliexpress microSD cards (less than €1) can't be detected. Please don't use ultra low cost microSD cards. I bought a good bunch of them from AliExpress and all worked except one. But please don't play the roulette with yout data | Won't fix |
